## Introduction
Our project aims to build an **interactive dashboard** to visualize subreddits within the Reddit network. This dashboard will allow viewers to filter subreddit connections by:
- Temporal evolution  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Network structure  
- Subreddit attributes  
- Content similarity  

---

## Motivation
Reddit hosts a vast array of specialized subreddits that act as a melting pot of social interests and sentiments. This makes it an ideal platform for exploring community interactions. By visualizing subreddit connections and filtering by sentiment, we aim to offer:
- A tool for professionals and researchers to identify trends and relationships across communities.
- A platform for casual users to explore common topics and emotional tones that bind or divide communities of interest.

---

## Implementation
Using the **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)** package in Python, we will develop the dashboard with the following technologies:
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** for data processing and analytics  
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)** for interactive visualizations  
- **[Pyvis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/)** for network visualizations  
- Additional tools to support visualization and analysis  

---

## Dataset
Our project will utilize the following datasets:
1. **Reddit Hyperlink Social Network**  
   [Link to dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html)  
2. **Reddit Threads**  
   [Link to dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/reddit_threads.html)  

These datasets provide subreddit hyperlink networks, including temporal, sentiment, and text data for analysis.

---

## Goals
- Develop an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
- Enable filtering by sentiment, time, and network properties.
- Provide insights into subreddit relationships and sentiment trends.
